Search for `TO DO:`s within the project and complete them.
Add clean logging.
Add log path to config.
Revisit statuses on nodes.
Revisit status factories on masters.
    The other part of this is verify that we need multiple masters.
    One actually might be fine, which is why it was moved to common.
    go build github.com/magnesium38/lbdemo/common/master -o output.exe
AKA actually do statuses at some point.

Check what RPC names to send stuff to.
    Work
    Status

Consider joining app, reader and writer node into one process and add a flag
  for which one will be ran. This is assuming master is common.

The load balancers need to be split up.
    The reader load balancer needs to know what readers are reading what
      channels so that they can send part commands appropriately.
    Writer load balancer needs to keep track on how many messages have been
      sent by the writers to determine if it needs to spin up another one.
    App server is fine I think.

Rather than one node then, what about node/master in the same process.

Clean up error messages. A lot of them too stack trace-y, rather than helpful.


Major to do list.
    Check Errors.
        Reader's reader.Readstring should match writers.
    Setup logging.
    Do statuses.
    A way for master to start and stop nodes.
