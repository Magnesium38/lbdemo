The load balancers need to be split up.
    The reader load balancer needs to know what readers are reading what
      channels so that they can send part commands appropriately.

      sent by the writers to determine if it needs to spin up another one.
    App server is fine I think.

Clean up error messages. A lot of them too stack trace-y, rather than helpful.

    Delegate will always go to the first node since workload isn't used.

Reader needs a different implemenation of ConnectionFactory, since workload
  is not accurate.
